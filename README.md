# Goal_Diary - Multi-Module Java Project (CIM Data)

**Goal_Diary** is an educational project designed as a personal diary to organize and complete daily Java exercises. This project is part of the first-year Java course at **CIM Data**.

It is structured as a **multi-module Maven project**, where each module corresponds to a week of practice (**Week_X**), and each day within that week contains one or more Java exercises (**Day_Y**).

---

## 📚 Objectives

- Organize Java exercises in a structured way, by weeks and days.
- Facilitate tracking of weekly progress.
- Maintain a clear and organized record of completed practices.
- Learn and practice fundamental Java concepts such as:
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Conditionals and loops
  - Arrays and collections
  - Classes, objects, and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
  - And more...

## 📦 Project Structure

The project is divided into weekly modules, with dedicated folders for each week and its corresponding days and exercises:
```
Goal_Diary/
├── Week_1/
│   ├── Day_1/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── com/
│   │   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── pom.xml
│   ├── Day_2/
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── pom.xml
├── Week_2/
│   ├── Day_1/
│   ├── Day_2/
│   ├── ...
├── Week_3/
│   ├── Day_1/
│   ├── Day_2/
│   ├── ...
├── README.md
├── ...
```

✅ Each `Week_X` corresponds to a week of practice.  
✅ Each `Day_Y` is an independent module with its own `pom.xml` and Maven structure.  
✅ Each day may include one or more Java exercises.
